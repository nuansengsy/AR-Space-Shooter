Load "Planet_Explosion.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the required explosion from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. Click the left mouse button to trigger the planet detonation sequence.

There are two different types of planet explosion; the first has the planet first slowing breaking up into fragments before exploding while the second explodes straight away. In addition, there are two extra effects included with a laser and energy beam destroying the planets.

Have fun!
